# Crop-Recommendation-System using IoT enabled data collection

This project proposes a crop recommendation system using Machine Learning algorithms along with IoT enabled data collection.
Smart Farming is the practise of automating and using Computer Technologies in farm- related activities. Smart Farming is growing as a recommendable option to benefit the crop yield.
IoT sensors are placed in a field and used to record levels of soil moisture content, temperature and NPK values. 
Various variables such as Nitrogen(N), Phosphorus(P), Potassium(K), temperature, humidity, rainfall, sowing season, and soil type are also considered to build the proposed crop recommendation system that recommends the best-yielding crop based on the other environmental factors. 
Multiple machine learning algorithms including Simple Variable Machine(SVM), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) are used and compared to identify the most efficient algorithm for the crop recommendation system.
The proposed system aims to develop a model that can help farmers increase their crop yield and quality by providing personalized recommendations based on environmental variables. 

# Sensors Used

NPK Sensor- Used to measure Nitrogen(N), Phosphorus(P) and Potassium(K)

Temperature- Used to measure temperature of soil

Soil Moisture- Collects water content of the soil to measure humidity of the soil
